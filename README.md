# Predicting-customer-churn-using-machine-learning
I used machine learning to build a model to predict which customers are most likely to churn. I used a variety of data sources, including customer demographics, usage patterns, and support tickets.

It is a Python code snippet that uses the LogisticRegression algorithm to build a model to predict customer churn.

The code snippet first loads the customer data from a CSV file. Then, it splits the data into features and target. The features are the customer demographics, usage patterns, and support tickets. The target is whether or not the customer churned.


To run the code snippet, you would need to save it as a Python file (e.g., predict_churn.py) and then run it in a terminal or command prompt:

python predict_churn.py

This would print the accuracy of the model to the console.
